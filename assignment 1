1. Values- 'hello' , -87.8 , 6
   Expressions- *,-,/,+

2. A string is a data type. It is collection of alphabetical characters.
   A variable is like a storage which stores some sort of data type like string, integer, float etc. The name of a varible can not start from with a integer or symbol.

3. String- This data type stores alphabetical charaters. eg- 'Hellow', 'My name is Ajayraj' etc.
   Integers- This data type store numbers. eg- 100, 5, 85, 0 etc
   Floats- The decimal numbers are stored as floats. eg- 3.14, 5.0, 6.5555555

4. An expression is a combination of one or multiple operators.
   Expression is used to obtain desired results.

5. In assignment statement like spam=10 we are storing the value 10 in spam variable but in expression, operators are combined to obtain a desired result.

6. bacon=22
   bacon+1

   This will give the result 23 but bacon still contains the value 22.

7. 'spamspamspam'
   'spamspamspam'

8. eggs is valid because python allows intiation of variable name from alphabetical charaters but 100 is invalid because varible name can not start from a number.

9. a=10
   string_value=str(a)
   This will give string value of a i.e. '10'.

   float_value=float(a)
   This will give float value of a i.e. '10.0'.

   integer_value=int(a)
   This will give integer value of a i.e. 10.

10. This expression is showing error because concatination is allowed etween similar data types.

    'I have eaten '+'99'+' burritos'

    This will resolve the error.
